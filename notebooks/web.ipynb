    "This simple notebook focuses on determining the carbon intensity of a given website based on its IP address. Initially, it presents a method to derive the IP address from a URL. Once the IP address is obtained, the notebook proceeds to query the IP-to-CO2 Intensity API, revealing the average annual grid intensity associated with the IP's geographical location. This exercise offers insights into the environmental impact of digital infrastructures and highlights the importance of sustainable web."

    "\n",
    "- **Carbon Intensity:**\n",
    "The carbon_intensity data returned by the endpoint is provided by [Ember](https://ember-climate.org/data/data-explorer/). The figures returned are annual, average amounts presenting the grams per kilowatt-hour (g/kWh).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is average intensity ?**\n",
    "Average emissions intensity uses the fuel mix of the entire electricity grid and can be used to derive estimates for the carbon footprint of a digital product or service. Youâ€™ll see average intensity used in the majority of carbon reporting standards and tooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How is it different from marginal intensity ?**\n",
    "Marginal intensity, on the other hand, looks at where the additional electricity to power a device, product or service would come from. In almost all cases it would be from a fossil-fuel power source, and so marginal intensity figures tend to be higher than average intensity figures. The [*Green Software Foundation*](https://greensoftware.foundation/) is one group that uses marginal intensity as part of its specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generation from Fossil:**\n",
    "The generation_from_fossil figure represents the fraction of total annual electricity that was generated by fossil fuel sources. This data is provided by Ember. Their methodologies for calculating generation and aggregates can be found on their website.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Year:**\n",
    "The year returned represents the calendar year the data refers to. Since the dataset is updated yearly, in most cases this will show the previous calendar year."
